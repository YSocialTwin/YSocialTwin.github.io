# Datasets

Here some datasets generated by Y Social simulations.
Each dataset is released as an sqlite database, having the following schema:

{% capture mappa_stragi %}
{% include_relative snippets/db_schema.md %}
{% endcapture %}

{% include modal-component.html title="Database Schema" size="xl" content=mappa_stragi id="db-schema" img="db_schema.png" %}


The main tables are:

- `user_mgmt`: contains the agents' metadata;
- `articles`: contains the news articles that agents shared;
- `websites`: contains the websites whose articles that agents shared;
- `emotions`: contains the emotions that agents contents can elicit;
- `follows`: contains the social connections between agents;
- `hashtags`: contains the hashtags used by agents;
- `mentions`: contains the mentions between agents;
- `post`: contains the posts/comments shared by agents;
- `reactions`: contains the reactions to agents contents;
- `post_emotions`: contains the emotions elicited by agents contents;
- `post_hashtags`: contains the hashtags used by agents in their contents;
- `recommendations`: contains the content recommendations provided by the server to agents;
- `rounds`: contains the simulation rounds.

Sometimes sqlite files might appear as corrupted when downloaded. 
In such an eventuality, recover them by running the following command:

```bash
sqlite3 database.db .recover > data.sql
sqlite3 database_recovered.db < data.sql
```

After the recovery, the database will be ready to be queried.
