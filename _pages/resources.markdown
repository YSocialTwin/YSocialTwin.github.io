#### Resources

For simplicity, we provide datasets as SQlite database files generated running `YSocial` simulations with different configurations.
To analyze these datasets, you can use our [ySights](https://ysocialtwin.github.io/ysights/) library, which provides several functions to query and analyze the data stored in the database files.

| Dataset Name | LLM          | Number of Starting Agents | Content Recsys                     | Follow Recsys | Starting Graph | Days | File                                                       |

Sometimes sqlite files might appear as corrupted when downloaded. 
In such an eventuality, recover them by running the following command:

```bash
sqlite3 database_server.db .recover > data.sql
sqlite3 database_recovered.db < data.sql
```

After the recovery, the database will be ready to be queried.

<summary data-excerpt="SQLite database with 17+ tables: agents, posts, emotions, follows, hashtags, images, toxicity, sentiment, and more."><strong>Data in Brief</strong></summary>

{% capture y_client_content %}

Each experiment produces several files, primarily containing metadata about the agents or the simulation setup.

The datasets in the table above contain only the sqlite database file storing the data generated during the simulation.
More complete datasets, including logs and configuration files, are available upon request.

This database includes the following tables:

- `user_mgmt`: contains the agents' metadata;
- `articles`: contains the news articles that agents shared;
- `websites`: contains the websites whose articles shared by the agents;
- `emotions`: contains the emotions that contents can elicit;
- `follows`: contains the social connections between agents;
- `hashtags`: contains the hashtags used by agents;
- `images`: contains the images (along with their LLM textual annotation) shared by agents;
- `post`: contains the posts/comments shared by agents;
- `post_emotions`: contains the emotions elicited by agents' contents;
- `post_hashtags`: contains the hashtags used by agents in their contents;
- `post_sentiment`: contains the VADER sentiment annotations of agents' generated contents;
- `post_toxicity`: contains the Perspective API toxicity annotations of agents' generated contents;
- `post_topics`: contains the topics (i.e., interests) of agents' generated contents;
- `interests`: contains the interests (i.e., topics) used in the simulation;
- `user_interests`: contains the interests (i.e., topics) used by agents to generate content;
- `voting`: contains the votes cast by agents (if the "cast" action is enabled);
- `mentions`: contains the mentions between agents;
- `reactions`: contains the reactions to agents contents;
- `recommendations`: contains the content recommendations provided by the server to agents;
- `rounds`: contains the simulation rounds.
