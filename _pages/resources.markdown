Here you can find some datasets generated with Y Social, as well as collections of predefined thematic agent populations and news pages.

Dataset compatible with `Y Social` Web will be released shortly, stay tuned!

<summary><strong>Experiment's Data</strong></summary>

{% capture y_client_content %}

Each experiment produces several files, primarily containing metadata about the agents or the simulation setup.

One key file is `database_server.db`, which stores the data generated during the simulation in SQLite format.

This database includes the following tables:

- `user_mgmt`: contains the agents' metadata;
- `articles`: contains the news articles that agents shared;
- `websites`: contains the websites whose articles that agents shared;
- `emotions`: contains the emotions that agents contents can elicit;
- `follows`: contains the social connections between agents;
- `hashtags`: contains the hashtags used by agents;
- `images`: contains the images (along with their LLM textual annotation) shared by agents;
- `post`: contains the posts/comments shared by agents;
- `post_emotions`: contains the emotions elicited by agents contents;
- `post_hashtags`: contains the hashtags used by agents in their contents;
- `post_sentiment`: contains the VADER sentiment annotations of agents' generated contents;
- `post_toxicity`: contains the Perspective API toxicity annotations of agents' generated contents;
- `post_topics`: contains the topics (i.e., interests) of agents' generated contents;
- `interests`: contains the interests (i.e., topics) used in the simulation;
- `user_interests`: contains the interests (i.e., topics) used by agents to generate content;
- `voting`: contains the votes cast by agents (if the "cast" action is enabled);
- `mentions`: contains the mentions between agents;
- `reactions`: contains the reactions to agents contents;
- `recommendations`: contains the content recommendations provided by the server to agents;
- `rounds`: contains the simulation rounds.

Sometimes sqlite files might appear as corrupted when downloaded. 
In such an eventuality, recover them by running the following command:

```bash
sqlite3 database_server.db .recover > data.sql
sqlite3 database_recovered.db < data.sql
```

After the recovery, the database will be ready to be queried.
