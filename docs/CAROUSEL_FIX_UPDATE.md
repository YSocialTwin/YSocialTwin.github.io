# Carousel Fix Update - Timing Issue Resolution

## Problem Reported
After the initial fix, the user reported:
1. Index page carousel stopped working (it was working before)
2. Key features page carousels (2 carousels) were still not working

## Root Cause Analysis

The issue was **not** with the logic of the code, but with **timing**:
- The JavaScript code was executing before the DOM elements were fully rendered
- When `querySelector('.custom-carousel')` was called, the carousel HTML hadn't been created yet
- This caused the script to exit early with the `if (!carousel) return;` check

### Why This Happened
Jekyll processes markdown files and converts them to HTML. The script tags in the markdown are executed when the HTML is loaded, but the order of execution can vary. Without a `DOMContentLoaded` wrapper, the script might run before all DOM elements are ready.

## Solution

Wrapped all carousel initialization code in `document.addEventListener('DOMContentLoaded', function() { ... })`:

### Before (Broken)
```javascript
<script>
(function() {
  const carousel = document.querySelector('.custom-carousel');
  if (!carousel) return;  // Would exit early if DOM not ready
  // ... initialization code
})();
</script>
```

### After (Fixed)
```javascript
<script>
document.addEventListener('DOMContentLoaded', function() {
  const carousel = document.querySelector('.custom-carousel');
  if (!carousel) {
    console.log('Carousel not found on index page');
    return;
  }
  // ... initialization code
});
</script>
```

## Debug Features Added

Added console logging to help diagnose future issues:

**Index Page:**
- `console.log('Carousel not found on index page')` - if carousel element missing
- `console.log('Carousel buttons not found')` - if next/prev buttons missing
- `console.log('Index carousel initialized with X items')` - on success

**Key Features Page:**
- `console.log('Found X carousels on key_features page')` - shows how many carousels found
- `console.log('Carousel X: buttons not found')` - if buttons missing for specific carousel
- `console.log('Carousel X initialized with Y items')` - on success for each carousel

## Testing

Created two comprehensive test files:

1. **test_index_carousel.html** - Simulates single carousel (like index page)
2. **test_key_features_carousel.html** - Simulates two carousels (like key_features page)

Both tests confirmed:
- ✅ Carousels initialize correctly
- ✅ Navigation buttons work independently
- ✅ Console logs provide clear feedback
- ✅ No interference between multiple carousels

## Files Modified

1. `_pages/index.markdown` - Added DOMContentLoaded wrapper and debug logging
2. `_pages/key_features.markdown` - Added DOMContentLoaded wrapper and debug logging
3. `test_index_carousel.html` - New test file
4. `test_key_features_carousel.html` - New test file

## Verification Steps

After Jekyll rebuilds the site:

1. **Index Page:**
   - Open browser console
   - Look for: `Index carousel initialized with X items`
   - Test navigation buttons

2. **Key Features Page:**
   - Open browser console
   - Look for: `Found 2 carousels on key_features page`
   - Look for: `Carousel 0 initialized with X items`
   - Look for: `Carousel 1 initialized with X items`
   - Test navigation buttons on both carousels

## Console Warnings (Unrelated)

The warnings about headings not having IDs:
```
Heading :Perfect for Your Research Needs does not have id. Can't place anchor here
```

These are generated by `chulapa_script.js` (the Jekyll theme) and are unrelated to carousel functionality. They can be safely ignored.

## Summary

The fix ensures that:
- All carousel JavaScript waits for DOM to be ready before executing
- Debug logs help identify issues quickly
- Both single and multiple carousel configurations work correctly
- Each carousel operates independently without conflicts
