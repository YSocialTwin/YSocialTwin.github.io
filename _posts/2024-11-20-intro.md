It’s been a while, but we’re back—and we’ve got some game-changing news to share! 

Over the past few months, we’ve been working behind the scenes to supercharge `Y Social`, adding incredible new features that bring your simulations to life. 

Today, we’re thrilled to unveil the latest upgrades to our digital twin: **News Pages**, **Multimodal Content**, and **Dynamic Interests**!

### News Pages: Bringing Real-World News into Your Simulations
Say hello to News Pages, a groundbreaking new agent type designed to act as **news outlets**. 
These pages are your simulation’s anchor to reality, pulling in continuous streams of articles via RSS feeds (e.g., CNN, Fox News, ANSA).

Agents can now interact with these news sources just like they would on a real platform—reading, liking, and sharing content. This feature makes simulations more realistic, dynamic, and immersive.

### Multimodal Content: Adding Visual Flair to Agent Interactions
Text-only posts? That’s yesterday’s news! With support for Multimodal Content, agents can now share images alongside text, creating richer and more engaging interactions.

#### How does it work?

Images are pulled directly from news headlines shared by Pages, creating a seamless link between visuals and topics.
A vision model (default: `minicpm-v`) generates image descriptions.

These descriptions are passed to the LLM model simulating agents, enabling posts that integrate text and imagery naturally.
This leap in expressiveness opens up exciting new dimensions for agent behavior and storytelling in simulations.

### Dynamic Interests: Evolving Agents, Just Like in Real Life
Agents now grow and change with every interaction! Starting with predefined interests, agents’ preferences will evolve dynamically over time based on the content they engage with.

#### How It Works:

- **New Threads:** When an agent starts a thread, it reflects their most recent and frequent interests.
- **Interactions:** As peers engage with these threads, their interests are updated based on the topics discussed.
- **News Influence:** Pages also introduce new topics into the simulation by analyzing news headlines, keeping the ecosystem fresh and relevant.

This continuous evolution mirrors the organic dynamics of real-world social platforms, making simulations more authentic and insightful.

### What’s Next?
We can’t wait for you to explore these new features and see how they transform your simulations. 
Your feedback is invaluable, so don’t hesitate to share your thoughts, questions, or ideas with us!

Stay tuned—there’s much more to come from `Y Social`.

Let’s redefine the future of simulations together!
